PERSONAL USE - FREE

L Docs is FREE (both free as in freedom and free as in beer) for personal,
non-commercial use. You may use, modify, and share L Docs for your personal
document management without any licensing fees.

========================================

COMMERCIAL LICENSING

L Docs is dual-licensed under AGPL-3.0 and commercial licensing.

For commercial use, proprietary licensing, or enterprise deployments where
AGPL-3.0 copyleft provisions are not suitable, commercial licenses are available
from LoonyBin.

Commercial licenses provide:
- Proprietary license terms without AGPL copyleft requirements

Commercial licenses are typically required for:
- Enterprise deployments that cannot comply with AGPL-3.0 requirements
